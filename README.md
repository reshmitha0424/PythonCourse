# PythonCourse

## 1.	Installing Python
-	python.org – download the latest version (now 3.17)
-	jetbrains.com/pycharm - for the code editor – PyCharm
IDE – Integrated Development Environment

  About the interface
-	Open PyCharm – hit new project – make sure to select the latest version of python
-	When the editor is open, right click on the new project, then on new python file, give it a name with the python extension (ex: app.py)
-	Write the code on the editor and then hit run to get the code executed. (shortcut: shift+fn+f10)

  How the python code gets executed 
-	Python code gets executed line by line 

## 2.	Variables 
-	Used to temporarily store the data in the computer’s memory

i.	Integers – numbers without a decimal point. 

ii.	Floating point number/float – numbers with decimal point. 

iii.	Strings

iv.	Boolean – True/ False

-	Python is case sensitive – when defining variables use the lower case values. But for like the Boolean values we should use True, False as they are the special keywords in the language. 
-	Simple values – integers, float, string, Boolean
-	Complex values – lists, etc. 

## 3.	Getting the input
-	input()
-	name = input(“What is your name?”)
The interpreter prints “What is your name?” on the terminal for the user to give their name as the input. The value that the user gives is stored in the variable called ‘name’.
